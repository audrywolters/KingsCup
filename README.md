## Application Name
King's Cup

## Languages Used
-Objective-C

## Description
King's Cup (also known as Categories) is a drinking game traditionally played with a deck of cards (and a lot of scribbly papers). 
This is an iPhone version. 
2 - 6 players take turns drawing a random card. Depending on what the card says, someone will probably have to take a drink!
Pictionary, charades, memory games, and impromptu dance parties are some of the fun things players get to do!

## I Learned
This is the first application I built 98% on my own. I even made all the graphics!
I knew Java but had never touched Objective-C nor graphics manipulation.
I learned a very different way of structuring files and (at that time) iOS's approach to a code MVC but also a View MVC.
Tricky but I enjoyed it.

## Next Steps
I would love to rebuild this in Swift and hopefully get it in the App Store.
